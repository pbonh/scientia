## Definition

Type inference is the TypeScript compiler's ability to deduce the data type of a variable, function return value, or expression automatically, without an explicit type annotation, by examining the values and operations in the source code.

## How It Works

When a variable is initialized with a literal or expression, the compiler infers the narrowest practical type. For example, `let x = 10` infers `number`, and `let y = [1, 2]` infers `number[]`. Generic function calls infer type arguments from the supplied parameters. The `declaration` compiler option can emit `.d.ts` files that reveal the inferred types for inspection.

Inference flows through control structures as well: a variable initialized as `string | number` can be narrowed to `string` inside an `if (typeof val === 'string')` block.

## Key Parameters

- Inference is the default behavior; annotations are only required where the compiler lacks enough context.
- `noImplicitAny` forces an error when the compiler cannot infer a type and no annotation is present.
- The `const` assertion (`as const`) tells the compiler to infer the narrowest literal type rather than widening to the base primitive.
- **Readability trade-off**: A spelled-out type is more valuable than a comment because it is enforced by the compiler. When inference produces a type that is too complex for a human reader to reconstruct (e.g., nested conditional types), an explicit annotation improves maintainability.

## When To Use

- Rely on inference for local variables with immediate initialization to reduce boilerplate.
- Use explicit annotations when exporting a public API, when a variable is declared before initialization, or when the inferred type is wider than needed.

## Risks & Pitfalls

- **Widening**: `let arr = [1, 2]` infers `number[]`, losing the information that it has exactly two elements. Use `as const` or a tuple annotation to preserve length information.
- **Any creep**: Without `noImplicitAny`, uninitialized or ambiguous variables silently receive the `any` type, bypassing type safety.
- **Human vs. compiler comprehension**: The compiler can infer types that a developer would struggle to read. When code review or debugging requires understanding the contract, prefer explicit annotations over deep inference.
